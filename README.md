<h1>Task-04 Personal Portfolio Website
 </h1>
 <p>I've created a Personal Portfolio Website that showcases skills, projects, and accomplishments as a web developer with an attractive and visually appealing layout that captures visitors' attention including a home page with a captivating headline, professional photo, and summary of skills. An "About Me" section with a detailed background, education, and professional experience.
